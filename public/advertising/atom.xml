    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many online marketing campaigns regard pay-per-click (PPC) advertising as a vital component in its strategy. Apart from being amongst the most significant factors, it can also be the most expensive, which is why it's vital to keep track of all the investments.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The first step towards leading an effective PPC campaign is to decide what to write in an advertisement. In order for the advertisement to work in our interest, there are four key factors we need to concentrate on. These consist of:</p>

<h2>The Headline</h2>

<p>The headline is the first line of the advertisement, and it must be strong enough to grasp the readers’ attention quickly. In this case, shorter is better. The headline is there to shine light upon what is being offered. An ideal length would be 4-5 words, but the aim here is to keep your message as short and to-the-point as possible. The headline will be in a different color than the rest of the text, usually blue. The headline may also consist of keywords that will show up in bold in a Google search.</p>

<h2>The Body Text</h2>

<p>The body text will consist of 1-2 lines, and should be similar to a page’s meta-tag description. Searchers will be looking for something that will give them a little more idea of what you have to offer, and your body text must be strong enough to convey the message.</p>

<h2>Keywords</h2>

<p>Take some time to think of what terms a consumer might search on to find your product or company. At this point, testing on what keywords work best and coming up with keyword-advertisement combinations will help you succeed.</p>

<h2>The Landing Page</h2>

<p>The landing page also pays an important part in PPC advertisements. The URL, in order to be effective, should take the consumer to the company’s product page, unless the company’s homepage acts second to a product page.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Consider camel casing each word and using your target keyword in the display URL to increase click through rate. Example: www.AcmeWidgetCompany.com/Blue-Widgets</p>

<p>In this example, we'll use Google AdWords to demonstrate proper PPC A/B testing or split testing. In order for the campaign to work to its maximum potential, the user must show variations by split-testing advertisements. Most users will not have access to complex tools, but low-tech variations can be run from something as simple as an Excel spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> At the initial stage, dynamic insertion should be ignored and ad optimization should be turned off, since we want all advertisements to be shown with equal probability.</p>

<p>Assuming that only the advertisement and not the landing page is being tested; you can come up with a table that looks something like this:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Ad # </th>
<th> Title </th>
<th> Description 1 </th>
<th> Description 2 </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

<p>Following exponential numbers, we just created 8 advertisements with 2 variations on each line. As the number of variations increase, the numbers go up, and this is where the testing comes in. As far as the testing goes, there are some important factors we need to keep in mind. These consist of:</p>

<ol>
<li>All variations must be tested simultaneously to reduce time-based factors that may result in biased results.</li>
<li>Test one thing at a time, so you can tell what’s affecting the success of your advertisements.</li>
<li>Let the numbers decide what’s right, not your instincts.</li>
<li>Test your advertisements long enough. For example, depending upon the type of product the company has to offer, the advertisement may get less than 100 impressions a day, or 10,000 impressions a week. In any case, you must have a few thousand impressions to reach an unbiased conclusion. Also, any special events like holidays coming up should be taken into account, since these usually result in a different type of traffic.</li>
</ol>


<p>Keep in mind that advertisements and landing pages will be directly related to each other, and different advertisement and landing page combinations can lead to different conversion rates.</p>

<p>Results can also be customized to show you what you're looking for. Custom reports can help you organize your reports by CTR, number and rate of transactions, and total profits. Reports like transaction rates also help you keep track of how many consumers are returning customers.</p>

<p>A/B testing may seem like a lot of work, but it will prove beneficial in the long run, since it helps you get the most out of your advertising budget. Having access to advanced toolsets will definitely help, but low-scale split-testing may prove just as good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What’s an advertisement? An advertisement is any notice or announcement to promote an idea, product, service or an event. It could be announced through the television, radio, or the internet. There are endless possibilities when it comes to how you want to advertise your item or idea. Some people go through vigorous pains and have huge events to officially announce their items while others do it more quietly on television or internet. Not only do advertisements help customers getting familiarized with the product but also help the company that is promoting it. Something more efficient than an advertisement is an advertising copy; or Ad copy for short. But what is an advertising copy?</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What Exactly Is Ad Copy?</h2>

<p>Advertising copy can be found anywhere on the internet. In the search results. In your Facebook or Twitter feed. They are created specifically to catch someone’s eyes, and eventually make said person click the ad copy. Usually Ad copies are either contextual or pay per click. Ad copies can be actually anything; from catchy product titles to enticing product pictures with text on them. Text of the ad copy is usually the second or third line of an ad displayed on a search engine result page or any other web page. Most ad copy makers usually add keywords about usage of the product along with the few catchy lines. This is to gather more audience for their ads. When a person searches a specific keyword on a search engine they will be linked to the ad copy if it has anything to do with it.</p>

<h2>Ad Copy – A Bridge Between Search Results and Websites</h2>

<p>Present time marketing is becoming more challenging to handle. With each passing day it is becoming more aggressive. Since there is always competition in the marketplace you need to make sure that your ad copies are distinct, unique and eye catching. It basically serves as the communication point between the search results and your website. The more you make your ad copies attractive the more appealing they will be towards everyday consumers. Make sure to include details about your product in your ad copy while you are at it, keep the FAQs of the general audience in mind. For example, how helpful it is compared to other products, advantages, disadvantages but more importantly, keep it short and simple. Because the last thing you would want is a dull ad that no one pays attention to.</p>

<h2>What’s the Goal of Your Ad?</h2>

<p>Focus on the goal you are creating an ad for. Interest a customer by informing them how your product can change their life, as clearly as possible. This is a vital ingredient for the ad copy. You need to include how far superior your item is towards others and how much more it can help your customers in changing their life. But do this indirectly as you do not want to stir trouble by openly bashing against a specific product or company. Your main goal should be to define the unique points of your product/service since they tend to attract customers into making a direct action. The probability rises if there is call to actions in your ads because the viewers are keen to mimic them.</p>

<p>Building credibility should be one of your advertisement goals. Offer the audience believability about the product, brand, or idea that you are advertising about. If your product is linked to everyday life it’ll have a better chance of being bought.</p>

<h2>Details, Details, Details</h2>

<p>Another core ingredient in your ad copy is grammar and punctuation. This is extremely important. You need to use simple words to get your idea crystal-clear to the audience. Do not pick lengthy words at random and put them in your ad copy thinking it’ll make it sound intelligent. It won’t. It also won’t help people understand what you’re talking about. Be specific and straight to the point. Remember you want your product to make an impression on people.</p>

<h2>Test-Drive your Ad</h2>

<p>At last before ever going out to make an ad copy or to even think about advertising your time you need to test your product, item, or idea. Will it attract everyday consumers? Does it spark an interest in someone? What things is it capable that other products are not. Ask yourself these questions before you advertise. More importantly do not promise consumers anything about your item. It is bad for your company image if you’re caught lying. Remember, make a good impression on people and they will definitely come back for more.</p>
