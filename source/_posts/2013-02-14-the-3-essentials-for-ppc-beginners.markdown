PPC or pay-per-click advertisements play a significant role in a company’s online marketing campaign. PPCs, when bought from reputable companies like Microsoft and Google, can also have a significant price tag attached to it, which is why it may be important to use these advertisements to their maximum potential.

The best way to do this would be to split advertisements into different variations. However, once that is done, there are some things we need to keep in mind.

## Things to Remember

Firstly, we need to focus on giving the advertisement as much disclosure as possible. The best way to do this would be to integrate a consumer’s search query within the advertisement itself. This will highlight the advertisement in bold on the search page, giving the company an upper hand over others. Secondly, the advertisement will consist of the terms the consumer searched on, which will make it more appropriate for both sides.

Another thing that we have to keep in mind is our ability to compete.  Keeping an eye out for their messages would help us determine our stance in the market, as well as help us decide whether using aggressive marketing techniques or claims would be worth it. The best way to start of with this would be to determine how strong a company’s reputation is. A simple Google search may do the trick, and if the company uses other sources of media for advertisement like newspapers and TV, the PPCs could be made parallel to them, helping it reverberate within potential and existing customers.

## Significance of Keywords and Landing URLs:

Keywords and landing URL also play a significant role in where our advertisements end up. We can experiment by changing one keyword at a time, and comparing the results. For example, ‘buy’ can be substituted with ‘compare prices’, and the results could be gathered over time to show which words attract larger masses. As far as the landing URL goes, the company must make sure that clicking on the advertisement takes the customer to the product page and not the company's homepage, unless the homepage doubles as a product page. Alternately, the company can also create a mini-website or a small portal for users who click on the advertisement, ensuring that customers find the information that they're looking for.

## Clicks for Conversions and Conversions for the Bank:

When it comes to advertising successfully, it would be best to ignore the click-through rate (CTR) and focus more on the conversion rate. The conversion rate will help to determine how much money is being spent on every keyword, and how much returns they give, apart from telling us how often a click on the advertisement resulted in a meaningful action like a sale or sign-up. However factors like position and day of the week must be taken into account in order to reach an unbiased conclusion. Companies like Google may also offer services like Google Merchant Centre, which may give companies an extra platform for product extension.

Another important factor that may impact a company's PPC would be its advertising budget. In some cases, the company may simply expect too much out of its advertising campaign at a very initial stage. This may result in the business giving up too soon, or it may simply run out of funds to continue its campaign before it turns profitable, although it may help if a company has a preplanned advertising budget.  A company must also learn to exploit the free tools offered by the advertising company to their maximum potential. For example, tools like Google Adwords can help calculate the conversion rate and cost per advertisement.

Getting started on PPC ads may be a significant step for a company, but the only way to maximize profits would be to use this opportunity in the most productive way possible. Thanks to the free tools being offered by most advertising companies, managing costs and productivity has gotten a lot easier. A perfect combination of patience and management would ultimately lead the company to success.
